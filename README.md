# Workday Checker

## Functionality

Enter a date in three parts:

1. the month of the year,
2. the day of the month, and
3. the year.

The application will then determine if that date is a standard workday in the United States.

## Limitations

1. Currently, the application only supports dates in the last three years (2020, 2021, and 2022)

## Error Checking

1. If the year is not valid, a customized error message will display.
2. If any field is left blank, a customized error message will display.
3. If any other fields are populated with invalid values, a generic message will display.

## Deployment

The calculator is deployed online, using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [here](https://brandonholmes.github.io/WorkdayChecker/).
